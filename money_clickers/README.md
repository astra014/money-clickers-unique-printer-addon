Note that the amount of money gained per cycle in the video does not reflect on the actual values in the examples, as they can be configured and balanced however you want.

## Features
------
Gain money and points by clicking in the center circle!
Spend your hard earned points on upgrades through the upgrade menu to bring certain benefits to your Money Clicker, like automated clicking so that it prints while you are doing other things, click power to progress faster, cooling to prevent overheating and increase the storage capacity to hold more money and points!
* Unique functionality
* Simple, minimalistic and unique design
* Stackable - changes layout when stacked
* In-depth customizability
* Progression System
* Repair System
* Health System
* Customizable Upgrading System
* Points to spend on upgrades, etc

This addon is unlike any other printer addons out there to the point that it is no longer called a printer addon.
Combining printers and clicker apps into one makes it so players have to work for their upgrades by clicking to earn both cash and points to spend on upgrading the functionality.
Watch the showcase video for more information, as there are lots of things that are not clearly visible in the media photos!

## FastDL / Workshop
------
Money Clickers are configured to work with or without FastDL.
However, workshop can be used instead by adding the [content pack found here](http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=685912753) to your server collection for the clients to download.
If you do not wish to use the workshop and instead use FastDL, make sure you upload all the materials (preferably bzipped) correctly to your FastDL host.

## Customization
------
* Advanced and in-depth customization
* Easy to configure the basics, more in-depth configuration available
* Money and Points per cycle
* Prices for upgrades and reparation
* Upgrade names, stats and prices per level
* Configurable amount of cycles before breakdown
* Design color can be easily configured
* Enable or disable heat system
* Heat per cycle

Just about everything in the Money Clicker can be customized, featuring a unique system to add different tiers.
You are not limited to a certain number of tiers, you can add however many you want through the DarkRP entities.lua file that we all know about already.
Simply add more entities to DarkRP with different configurations!
Example tier setup can be found in the ***config*** file
